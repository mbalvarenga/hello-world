Declarative Examples
This folder is a home for snippets, tips and tricks and examples for writing Declarative Pipelines with the Jenkins Pipeline plugin.

Layout
The repository is broken up into two directories currently:

simple-examples - simple pipelines with one or two stages that illustrate or test a single part of Declarative Pipeline
jenkinsfile-examples - for examples of using Jenkinsfiles checked into repositories.
When contributing new examples please put them into the appropriate directory above. Make sure your script is commented so that others can understand how it works, why it works, etc.

License
All contributions are under the MIT license, like Jenkins itself.
